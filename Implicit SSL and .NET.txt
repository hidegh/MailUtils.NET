NOTE: 
	Theres a difference between explicit ssl (port 587 or it may be also 25) and the implicit ssl (465).

	Explicit SSL is a SMPT standard, while implicit is NOT.
	Implicit SSL is nowadays widely used, but .NET 4.5.2 does not have it in SmtpClient implemented.
	Implicit SSL was supported in System.Web.Mail.SmtpMail class, but it;s deprecated since .NET 2.0.
	
ALTERNATIVES:
	Chilkat - it's not free, but possibly the most advanced code...
	MailKit & MimeKit - autor: jstedfast (appreciate his quick reaction and bugfix)
	http://equinox.codeplex.com/ - still alpha version and implicit vs explicit ssl is switched...
		 
SO THE ONLY POSSIBLE FREE SOLUTION:
	MailKit - it's author knows what he do, takes case about encoding, etc.
